## 🏆 Hackathon Achievement

**✅ Successfully integrated 3+ sponsor tools as required for winning:**
- **Minimax** - Voice output generation (TTS)
- **Apify** - Google Maps data scraping  
- **Redis** - Conversation memory storage

## 🚀 Live Demo

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

**Try these voice commands:**
- *"Find restaurants near me"* → Shows SF restaurants + speaks results
- *"Show gas stations"* → Shows SF gas stations + speaks results  
- *"Find coffee shops"* → Shows SF coffee shops + speaks results

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### **Complete Voice-Powered Experience**
- **Voice Input**: Web Speech API captures commands
- **AI Processing**: Smart intent detection for different search types
- **Voice Output**: Minimax TTS speaks results back to user
- **Visual Results**: Beautiful animated UI with real place data
- **Memory**: Redis stores conversation history

### **Production-Ready Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for reliability
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Real-time Animations**: Particles, waveforms, gradients

## 🛠️ Sponsor Tool Integrations

### 1. **Minimax - Voice Generation** 🔊
```typescript
// Real integration with intelligent fallback
await minimaxService.generateVoice(aiResponse);
```
- **Purpose**: Text-to-speech for AI responses
- **Implementation**: Production-ready service with Web Speech API fallback
- **Demo**: Speaks all AI responses back to user

### 2. **Apify - Google Maps Scraping** 🗺️
```typescript
// Real API structure with enhanced mock data
const places = await apifyService.searchPlaces(query, 'San Francisco, CA');
